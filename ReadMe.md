# Work-In-Progress Indie Game
<img src="Sitting.png" width="336" height="196">

This is a summary of my experience working on my long-term game development project for three. It represents my journey as a programmer and artist. It is very much a work in progress and I will continue to work on it into the foreseeable future.
I hope to... No. I know I will someday publish it.

Notable features right now include satisfying platforming physics, a beat-em-up-style combat system with a handful of moves, a well-fleshed out dialog character system, a map editor, a developer console, an animation metadata editor, and some cutscenes.

This repository is a brief reflection on my experience thus far, and will be infrequently updated. I work on the game itself daily.

## Inspiration
When I was in high school, I played a fair bit of *Super Smash Brothers*. I liked the ease-of-control and satisfying combos the game enables, but disliked how fast-paced it is. Oftentimes I felt I was surrendering conscious control of characters to muscle memory and was disengaging from the game. This is not only *Smash Bros*'s problem, but a problem shared by most online multiplayer games. Because of this, as I've become older I've gravitated towards single-player experiences.

I've always admired action platformers for their ability to take a core concept that is so simple and evoke a thousand different emotions with it. From the wonder of *Super Mario Odyssey* to the playfulness of *Kirby and the Forgotten Land* to the quiet, contemplative caverns of *Hollow Knight*, such games allow the player to explore their worlds in a way that is very tangible while also giving room for experimentation and creativity.

Explicit rewards in games can often lead to a fear of missing out as well as an obsessive pursuit of in-game secrets. I want to motivate players to complete challenges and explore implicitly, rather than by dangling a carrot on a string in front of their face. While there will be a few hidden secret abilities, I wish to reward exploration through worldbuilding and with the inherent joy of exploration rather than with a tangible thing. 

The game's premise is currently top-secret information. My friends have described my ideas as absurdist. Despite being ridiculous, the game takes itself very seriously. The game strongly emphasizes worldbuilding through characters and environmental storytelling that intertwines with its rich combat and exploration.

## My Programming Journey
I came into this project with very little programming knowledge. When I started this project in December 2020, I had only taken up to my high school's data structures course. My initial project was made in Gamemaker Studio 2. While this attempt was valiant, it had the hallmarks of a beginner project. There were weird pseudo-multi-inheritance hierarchies enabled by dynamic typing, an abundance of redundant comments, an abuse of magic strings, and other strange workarounds to problems of my own invention. But something far worse was starting to appear in my programming mindset, something I wouldn't realize until much later. Overabstraction.

Around 5 months into the project, I decided to switch engines to Godot with C#. My reasons for doing so at the time were ill-informed, but I made the right decision as learning C# got me more interesting in programming methodology (as well as understanding the benefits of a semi-decent static type-checker). I researched object-oriented programming and tried with varying degrees of success to incorporate what I had learned into my project.

9 months into the project, I became interested in functional programming after having bugs related to data structures being mutated and ending up in invalid states. The culmination of this was the creation of a custom text markup system in F# for annotating character dialog with effects such as color changes and shakes and rendering it on screen. This also taught me better project management skills as I sunk 3 months focusing on dialog and internationalization when I didn't really have a game in the first place.

As I added more attacks to my characters, I became frustrated with the limitations of the process I was using, which involved using Godot's built-in animation playback features. It was tedious and time-consuming, with something as simple as a rename having seven different steps that required editing multiple configuration files. I decided to make a simple framedata editor to remedy this. It has no dependencies on the game and I chose to write it in C to improve my systems-programming skills. You can view this on my GitHub page. In about a week of working on it I had a timeline with multiple hitbox and hurtbox layers, three different shape types with draggable handles to adjust their size and position, undoing and redoing all editor actions, and serialization and deserialization. As I flesh out the game's combat, I will continue to add features to this editor as my needs become more apparent.

Over the years, I've come full circle from an uninformed procedural approach, to an object-oriented world-modelling approach, to a functional approach, all the way back to a more informed procedural approach. Much of my more recent code resembles my early code, but now I am better equipped to handle additional complexity I was so scared of in the beginnning. It's unfortunate that educational materials don't do a good job addressing the tradeoffs that certain techniques provide. They lead inexperienced people such as myself to pursue the "One True Way" to structure programs, only to make us introduce more complexity than the system initially had. Recently, I returned to the functional textbox system that took me three months to make. I needed more features, so I decided to rewrite it. I was able to do it in nine hours this time.

## My Artistic Journey
When I began this project, my interest in pixel art was minimal as I wanted to focus on programming and my lack of art skill was discouraging. However, as I learned more about game development, I was forced to confront the reality of the sheer amount of artwork I needed to produce to ship this game. During 2022, I focused much more on pixel art and animation as a result. I believe I made much progress as an artist and animator during this time.

I have to thank Adam C. Younis's wonderful video on his own progress in pixel art animation as inspiration for this section. <!-- credit his tutorials as well -->

I had no idea what I was doing, and just copied stick-figure run cycle animations from Google. This is a beginner's effort, and it clearly shows.                                                                                                                                                   |
|        <img src="Walk/Shrek.gif" width="160">         | Though these next two animations are fan-art sprites of a meme Youtube series featuring Shrek, I think they accurately represent my journey as an artist at this time. I made this first one in mid-2021, and is an evolution of the beginner's methodology demonstrated by the first image. I animated this straight-ahead on one layer. While the motion of each individual limb is somewhat smooth, there is a lack of cohesion in the overall image as well as some strange artefacts in the sword and head. |
| <img src="Walk/Shrek2.gif" width="160" height="160">  |                I made this next animation in early 2022. It is the first I made with a more iterative approach, starting with blobs of color for each limb and refining it. Only when I was satisfied with this initial version would I add the details. I am quite proud of how easy it is to trace the motion of the hair, arms, and kilt in this sprite. However, the motion of the legs is still somewhat confusing due to their similiar position and color, and the torso is rather stiff.                 |
|  <img src="Walk/Yeast.gif" width="160" height="160">  |             This is the current animation for the player run cycle which I made in December of 2022. The bobbing of the head and shoulders have a tight, rhythmic motion that I believe exudes the slightly-misguided confidence the player character has. The legs and especially the arms are much easier to track because of my more effective use of 3/4ths perspective. I chose to eschew outlines as they noticeably increased the time required to create sprites with little visual impact.              |

## Note about Game Engines
When I started this project, the internet presented the idea of creating a custom game engine as pointless. And for the beginner I was then, this was most definitely the case. But as I grow my skills and become more interested in systems programming, I find the idea of making a custom game engine more and more attractive. Godot and Unity follow a scene graph world-representation paradigm, and Gamemaker forces the user to use their proprietary, dynamically typed scripting language. I'm not going to rewrite this game in a custom engine. I need to ship a large-scale game to better understand what services I need a game engine to provide before I try to make my own. However, my next large game after this one is finished will use a custom engine in an unmanaged systems language. 

## Making Other Games
After reading all this, you may be thinking, "Hey, where are this guy's other games?". You are absolutely right to wonder this. The classic advice to learning game development is to start small. Iterate, go through projects quickly, and get your ten bad games out of the way fast so you can make your first good game. But if I had followed this advice, there is no way I would be in the position I am now. When I started working on this game in high school, I wasn't in a great place. I had kind of lost faith in myself, and I didn't know what was going to happen when I started college. I simply would not have been able to muster motivation to work on anything if it wasn't the one game I really wanted to make. So I clung to this project like a life-raft for three years now. But in order to finish this project, I need to branch out and gain experience elsewhere. I have some ideas for smaller games I'll make when my life obligations ease up, and I look forward to starting those soon. 

## Reflection
This project as been by far the most labor-intensive project I have ever worked on in my life. Despite sometimes becoming discouraged due to my inexperience and the resulting lack of tangible outcomes, I haven't given up for three years. I know I not only have a vision for a game that satisfies an unfilled niche but that I also have the means to see it through. I have learned so much about programming, art, project management, and game design, yet I still have only scratched the surface. I don't just want to make this game. I need to, and I look forward to the day when I can share it with the rest of the world.
